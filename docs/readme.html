    <h1>Custom Webauth</h1>
    <!--Demo code by ddunlap@cisco.com and leejohns@cisco.com-->
    <h2>Prerequisites for webauth testing (these need to work prior to
      configurating custom webauth)</h2>
    <ol>
      <li> make sure the PC gets an ip address *without* webauth
        configured (ssid alone, no authentication)
        <p>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>make sure the PC can ping the default gateway *without*
        webauth configured
        <p>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>make sure the PC knows where DNS-server is (ipconfig /all)
        *without* webauth configured
        <p>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>make sure the PC can resolve names (with 'nslookup
        &lt;blah&gt;') *without* webauth configured
        <p>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>make sure the PC can get to the internet *without* webauth
        configured
        <p></p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    Once those conditions are met, you can start to do more testing with
    webauth.
    <p> Note 1: For custom web-pages, you must be running 4.0.X code or
      higher.</p>
    <p>
      Note 2:<br>
      To force web-auth user to re-authenticate during testing (from the
      CLI):<br>
      "show client summary"<br>
      "config client deauthenticate &lt;mac&gt;"</p>
    <p>
      To force web-auth user to re-authenticate during testing (from the
      gui):<br>
      Monitor &gt; Clients &gt; Choose client &gt; Remove</p>
    <p>
      The mac of the user can be seen on the PC (ipconfig /all) and
      depending on the connection state, in the WLC gui (monitor &gt;
      clients) or in "show client summary" from WLC CLI.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <h2>Download and Edit of Custom Webauth Bundles</h2>
    <h3>Download</h3>
    Installation of custom web-auth bundles can be done via the gui
    (under 'Commands' &gt; 'download' &gt; 'webauth bundle' from a
    tftp-server) or the CLI:
    <p>
      transfer download serverip &lt;tftp-server&gt;<br>
      transfer download filename &lt;tarball&gt;<br>
      transfer download datatype webauthbundle<br>
      transfer download path /<br>
      transfer download start</p>
    <p>
      If the transfer is done using the CLI, debugs can be run to see
      the status of the transfer:<br>
    </p>
    <pre>debug transfer tftp enable
debug transfer trace enable
</pre>
    After the bundle is downloaded, the WLC is configured to use the
    custom page in Security &gt; Web auth &gt; Web Login Page. Use of a
    particular page for a wlan must also be configured under WLAN &gt;
    choose wlan &gt; Security &gt; Layer 3 &gt; Over-ride Global Config
    (Enable), Web Auth type (Customized/Downloaded), Login Page.
    <p>
    </p>
    <h3>Edit</h3>
    Please note that if the pages below work before editing but do not
    work after editing then there is a problem with the editing. It is a
    good idea to keep the original copy of our bundle, perhaps renamed.
    <p>
      Because of the way 'winzip' works, the hyperlinks from the readme
      may not work, but you will be able to drag and drop the
      directories/files.</p>
    <p>
      The webauth bundles to be located on the WLC must be in native
      unix format, i.e. 'tar'.<br>
      All tar files must contain a login.html (additional files may
      exist but a file called login.html must exist in the bundle). If
      there is not a file called login.html in the bundle, you will get
      an 'Error on Extracting Files'.</p>
    <p>
      PC tar utilities which seem to work include:<br>
      7-Zip<br>
      IZarc<br>
      PowerArchiver2007<br>
      Stuffit</p>
    <p>
      If tarring on unix, the command is:<br>
    </p>
    <pre>tar -cvf &lt;output.tar&gt; login.html<br>
</pre>
    for example if there is a directory with login.html, aup.html,
    yourlogo.jpg, entering:<br>
    <pre>tar -cvf login.tar *.*
</pre>
    will result in those 3 files going into login.tar to be loaded on
    the WLC:
    <pre>a aup.html 3K
a login.html 5K
a yourlogo.jpg 69K
</pre>
    Whether the files were tarred on a PC or unix, the WLC's native unix
    code untars the tar file on receipt/download.
    <p>
    </p>
    <h2>Actual Pages</h2>
    <h3>WLC Authentication</h3>
    This is an example custom webauth bundle when authentication is in
    use. This bundle goes on the WLC itself. It contains an Acceptable
    Use Policy (aup.html) and graphic (yourlogo.jpg) besides the base
    'login.html'.
    <p>
      <a href="./wap/login.tar">waa/login.tar</a>
    </p>
    <h3>WLC Passthrough</h3>
    This is an example custom webauth bundle when passthrough (user does
    'accept' or 'reject') is in use. This bundle goes on the WLC itself.
    It contains an Acceptable Use Policy (aup.html) and graphic
    (yourlogo.jpg) besides the base 'login.html'.
    <p>
      <a href="./wap/login.tar">wap/login.tar</a>
    </p>
    <h3>WLC Passthrough with Email</h3>
    This is an example custom webauth bundle when passthrough (user does
    'accept' or 'reject') is in use and there is a radius-server which
    will be used to collect users' entered email addresses. The 'Email
    Input' button under the WLAN also needs to be checked. The WLC will
    not make a decision based on the users' email but will forward the
    email to the radius-server in accounting records when it is entered.
    While the WLC code was enhanced with code changes as a result of
    CSCsu50080 which requires that the user put an '@' sign in the
    email, there is nothing to prevent users from entering
    mickey.mouse@guesswhere.com.
    <p>
      When email is configured, 'debug aaa all enable' will show the WLC
      sending an accounting record to the radius-server with:
    </p>
    <pre>User-Name....bozo@the.clown
Nas-Port (x1d)
NAS-IPaddress (in 4 hex octets)
framed-ip-address (that the user has in 4 hex octets)
NAS-Identifier (system name of the WLC)
Airespace/WLAN-Identifier (on the WLC)
Calling-Station-Id (PC's mac)
Called-station-id (WLC's ip address)
</pre>
    and other attributes including Acct-Session-Id, Acct-Authenticator,
    Tunnel-Type xd, tunnel-medium-type x6, tunnel-group-id '5',
    Acct-Status-Type.
    <p>
      This bundle goes on the WLC itself. It contains an Acceptable Use
      Policy (aup.html) and graphic (yourlogo.jpg) besides the base
      'login.html'.</p>
    <p>
      <a href="./waep/login.tar">waep/login.tar</a>
    </p>
    <h3>WLC Authentication with Customized Logout Page</h3>
    This is an example custom webauth bundle when authentication is in
    use. After successful login, the customized 'logout.html' page comes
    up. After unsuccessful login, the customized failed.html comes up.
    These pages will not be seen unless the user has popups enabled in
    the browser. This bundle goes on the WLC itself. It contains an
    Acceptable Use Policy (aup.html) and graphic (yourlogo.jpg) besides
    the base 'login.html'.
    <p>
      <a href="./logout/login.tar">logout/login.tar</a>
    </p>
    <h3>WLC Bundle with Per-WLAN Pages</h3>
    In WLC version 4.2 or greater, a webauth bundle with different views
    for different wlans is possible with the actual page chosen under
    the wlan. This is an example of multiple pages that can be used
    per-wlan as a custom webauth bundle. This bundle goes on the WLC
    itself. It contains multiple pages and an Acceptable Use Policy
    (aup.html) and graphic (yourlogo.jpg) besides the base 'login.html'.
    <p>
      <a href="./multbundle/login.tar">multbundle/login.tar</a>
    </p>
    <h3>WLC Bundle with Animated Graphics</h3>
    This is an example custom webauth bundle with animated gifs with
    authentication in use. After successful login, the customized
    'logout.html' page comes up. After unsuccessful login, the
    customized failed.html comes up. These pages will not be seen unless
    the user has popups enabled in the browser. This bundle goes on the
    WLC itself. It contains an Acceptable Use Policy (aup.html) and
    graphic (yourlogo.jpg) besides the base 'login.html'.

    <p>
      <b>Note for WLC Pages on External Server:</b>
    </p>
    <p>For any of the next 3 options, you will need to enable the WLC to
      send the traffic to the external-server by going to the WLC &amp;
      under security &gt; web login page, choosing 'External (Redirect
      to External Server)' &amp; inputting the ip address of the
      external web-server &amp; its url, for example web-server
      192.168.5.104 with url http://192.168.5.20/login.html. (If you
      have Microsoft WCS installed (wireless network management
      software), you can put the files in C:\Program Files\WCS#\webnms\
      directory to take advantage of its webserver for testing).</p>
    <p>
      If the WLC is a 2XXX, you do need a preauthentication acl on the
      webauth wlan. If you do not have that configured, you will see a
      weird 'looping' on the redirect url and it will fail. An example
      of such an acl is below.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <pre>10.1.1.1=WLC
10.1.1.20=DNS
10.1.1.23=DHCP
10.1.1.57=external web-server   

This acl allows dhcp to 10.1.1.23, DNS to 10.1.1.20, 
icmp to everything, http/https to 10.1.1.1, and 
http to the external webauth server.

    <h3>WLC Pages on External Server with Authentication</h3>
    These pages would go on an external webserver if that is to be used.
    They should not be in a tar format. When the pages are on an
    external webserver, the authentication is still performed on the WLC
    (or radius-server if the WLC is configured for that), just the pages
    reside on the external server. It is a good idea to be sure that the
    pages come up ok on the external server <b>without</b> webauth
    involved since webauth will not work unless the external webserver
    works. If WCS software happens to be installed in the network, the
    pages can be installed in its C:\Program Files\WCS#\webnms
    directory.

    <h3>WLC Pages on External Server with Passthrough and Email</h3>
    These pages would go on an external webserver if that is to be used.
    They should not be in a tar format. When the pages are on an
    external webserver, the passthrough is still performed on the WLC as
    is sending the entered email to the radius-server, just the pages
    reside on the external server. The 'Email Input' button under the
    WLAN also needs to be checked. It is a good idea to be sure that the

    </p>
    <h2>Caveats</h2>
    <h3>Browser Support</h3>
    Supported browsers for webauth are listed in the WLC per-version
    release-notes. If a browser is not listed in the release-notes, it
    still may work but has not been thoroughly tested. If one browser
    version works and another does not work at all, it is possible that
    the non-working browser does not support javascript, does not
    support redirects, renders pages poorly, etc. There is nothing that
    can be changed in the WLC configuration or custom web pages to 'add
    browser support'.
    <p>
    </p>
    <h3>SSL Cipher Options</h3>
    Different browsers may support different ssl cipher options. The
    ciphers in place on the WLC can be determined with 'show network
    summary' from the CLI. If a supported web browser does not work,
    this could be due to incompatible cipher options. The WLC cipher
    options can be changed - the following commands generally allow more
    browsers to work by not requirin 128-bit ciphers and also enabling
    sslv2:<br>
    <pre>config network secureweb cipher-option high disable
(^128-bit ciphers required or not - disable means 128-bit ciphers not required)
config network secureweb cipher-option sslv2 enable
(^Permits both the default sslv3 and the weaker sslv2)
</pre>
    <h3>Per-wlan Pages</h3>
    In WLC version 4.2 or greater, a webauth bundle with different views
    for different wlans is possible. The login.html, login-wlana.html,
    login-wlanb.html files are placed in one tar file and downloaded.
    Then by doing into WLAN &gt; Security &gt; Layer 3 &gt; Web auth
    type (Customized/Downloaded), you can choose the 'Login Page' to use
    (from the bundle).
    <p> </p>
    <h3>Preauthentication ACLs</h3>
    With the 2XXX platforms, a preauthentication acl must be used if
    authentication/passthrough is to be redirected to an <b>external</b>
    server. The acl should allow dhcp, dns, http, and icmp at a minimum.
    There are examples of WLC acls on the Cisco web-site.
    <p>
    </p>
    <h3>Encryption</h3>
    Webauth initial connections are https; subsequent traffic is http
    unless wep or wpa-psk encryption is also in use.
    <p>
    </p>
    <h3>MIE Pragma No-cache</h3>
    The webpages supplied are coded to deal with Microsoft Internet
    Explorer's buffering behavior:
    <p>
      If you see 'odd behavior' where MIE works ok when the 'general
      tab' has 'check for newer version of stared pages' instead of the
      default 'every visit to the page', then you are encountering a bug
      in the way MIE caches files. The examples here are coded to avoid
      the bug. If you do your own coding:</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <pre>"There is a 64K buffer that must be filled before a page is cached in
IE. The problem is that the vast majority of the pages using the Pragma
statement put it between the HEAD tags.<p>

The HEAD loads and the Pragma comes into play. The browser gets the go
ahead to not cache the page, however there is not yet a page to not
cache. Since the page hasn't filled the 64K buffer, there's no page so
the Pragma is ignored. Thus...the page is cached.
The solution is to play to the buffer. If you're really serious about
the Pragma working, place another set of HEAD tags at the bottom of the
document, before the end HTML tag and re-enter the Pragma. This is a
suggestion straight from Microsoft Support. The page would look like
             this:</p><p>
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;HEAD&gt;
&lt;TITLE&gt;---&lt;/TITLE&gt;
&lt;META HTTP-EQUIV="Pragma" CONTENT="no-cache"&gt;
&lt;/HEAD&gt;
&lt;BODY&gt;
Text in the Browser Window
&lt;/BODY&gt;
&lt;HEAD&gt;
&lt;META HTTP-EQUIV="Pragma" CONTENT="no-cache"&gt;
&lt;/HEAD&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
"
</p></pre>
    <h3>Javascript Variables</h3>
    The 4 variables that are available for processing in javascript are:
    <pre>the AP MAC
redirect url (the original place the user was going)
wlan name
switch url (the redirect formed)
</pre>
    These are seen in the html as 'args.whatever'.
    <p>
    </p>
    <h3>Use of DNS Field</h3>
    While external DNS does need to work for webauth to function well,
    if there is a desire for the user to see a FQDN on redirect instead
    of the virtual ip address (such as 1.1.1.1), the DNS field under
    Controller &gt; Interfaces &gt; Virtual interface can be populated.
    This should agree with what's in external DNS. This causes redirect
    appear as FQDN for the user.
    <p>
    </p>
    <h3>Virtual IP Address</h3>
    For testing purposes, one should be able to bring up
    https://&lt;virtual-ip&gt;/login.html. Check to be sure that the
    virtual ip address is correct in 'show run-config' and reboot the
    WLC after saving the configuration.
    <p>
    </p>
    <h3>Post Login Redirect</h3>
    If there is a desire to redirect the user to a particular web-page
    after successful login and this option is not in the Security &gt;
    Webauth gui, the redirect can be entered manually from the CLI:
    <p> config custom-web redirectUrl <url>' </url></p>
    <p>
      save config</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <h3>Linking within Webauth Bundle</h3>
    The ability to link to other pages in webauth bundle or have
    functioning javascript popups is somewhat version-specific due to
    CSCso58911. The ability to link to other pages, for example, the
    where user starts at login.html then there is a hyperlink to
    readmoreaboutit.html within the bundle, should normally work as
    should javascript popups (if enabled in the browser).
    <p>
    </p>
    <h3>Customized Logout and Failure Pages</h3>
    Customized login failure and logout pages are supported as a result
    of CSCsj14378.
    <p>
    </p>
    <h3>Maximum File-name and Bundle Size</h3>
    The maximum file-name size for webauth and within webauth is 32
    characters. "/images/cisco-webauth-logo-white-cropped.gif" is too
    long.
    <p>
      The maximum file-size for webauth untarred files is 1M.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <h3>HTTP vs. HTTPS</h3>
    Certificate warnings will be seen with https, not http. If the
    warnings are of concern, especially with passthrough, there is
    currently no support for 'http' webauth. 'https' webauth can be
    turned off in Management &gt; https/http but by turning on http and
    turning off https, this affects all operations on the WLC including
    WLC management (not just webauth).
    <p>

    <h3>Certificate Warnings</h3>
    Are unrelated to custom webauth.
    <p>
      Messages you might see could include:</p>
    <p>
      The security certificate was issued by a company you have not
      chosen to trust. View the certificate to determine whether you
      want to trust the certifying authority.</p>
    <p>
      Warnings may be seen if the CN on the certificate does not
      resolve, forward &amp; reverse lookup don't both work, lookup
      resolves to multiple names (should only resolve to the virtual),
      the security certificate date is invalid, or most typically when a
      WLC self-signed certificate is in use.</p>
    <p>
      If you are get a certificate warning with the WLC if there is no
      certificate on the PC that matches that on the WLC, this would be
      because there is no certificate in the PC's trusted root store
      that matches the self-signed certificate on the WLC. If you do
      'certmgr.msc' on the PC from the dos prompt &amp; look at Trusted
      Root Certs, there is a large list of certs that come with the PC.</p>
    <p>
      To avoid certificate warnings as a result of the WLC's self-signed
      certificate, you can either:</p>
    <p>
      install the WLC self-signed certificate on the PC when prompted </p>
    <p>
      or</p>
    <p>
      purchase a well-known 3rd party certificate for the WLC (to match
      one of the 3rd party vendors listed in the PC's store) and install
      it on the WLC.</p>
    <p>
      This document does not cover installation of non-self-signed
      certificates but there is information at: <br>
      <a href="http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/102/csr_wlc.html">http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/102/csr_wlc.html</a><br>
      that shows how to import an unchained 3rd party certificate
      (earlier than WLC 5.0 code).<br>

      shows how to import a chained 3rd party certificate (possible in
      5.0 WLC code or later).</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <h2>Radius</h2>
    When webauth authentication is involved, the WLC will check for
    username/password locally (on the WLC - Security Local Net Users)
    then send the request to radius (if there is one defined globally)
    if not found locally in the WLC database. The attributes sent are
    listed below. If the radius-server is sophisticated enough, it
    should be able to do refuse/allow based on the attributes sent in
    addition to the username/password. Radius attribute traffic can be
    seen with 'debug aaa all enable'.
    <p>
      Assuming the WLC local database works, you then define the
      radius-server under Security &gt; radius-authentication for the
      remote authentication. You also need to tell the radius-server
      about the WLC, ensuring that the keys match on both devices. If
      you have configured a radius-server for accounting under security,
      this will cause the username of the user to be sent in the
      accounting record.</p>

    <h3>Radius attributes sent for authentication </h3>
    <pre>Username (attribute 1)
Password (attribute 2 is encrypted):
Service-Type (attribute 6 = login)
NAS-IP-Address (attribute 4 = 4 hex bytes of WLC ip address)
NAS-Identifier (attribute 32 = name of WLC)
NAS-Port-Type (attribute 61 = x13 = dec-19 = wireless-802.11)
Vendor-specific (attribute 26 = the Airespace-WLAN-Id from the WLC - the number)
Calling-Station-ID (attribute 31 = NIC ip address in dotted-decimal)
Called-Station-ID (attribute 30 = WLC ip address in dotted-decimal)
</pre>
    <h3>Radius attributes honored in access-accept</h3>
    Radius attributes honored in access-accept - service-type can be '1'
    (login) or nothing returned but cannot be 'administrative==6'.<br>
    Access-list name (ACL-Name) and QoS (QoS-Level) settings can also be
    passed down using vendor-specific attributes.
